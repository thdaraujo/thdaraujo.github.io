Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll just add a little bit of SQL\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; Two minutes later, you end up with a bunch of nested case when statements, subqueries, commmon table expressions, angry statements, shouting, and a whole lot of tears. 😤  If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever tried to write a complicated order by statement with ActiveRecord, you probably know that it\u0026rsquo;s kind of painful, and you end up with ugly-looking code. That\u0026rsquo;s not what you want, right?\nThat sort of query quickly becomes unreadable as you add more and more cases to it.\nMost examples and tutorials don\u0026rsquo;t even mention that you might need to sanitize your query\u0026hellip; Not cool!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s okay to write raw SQL queries sometimes, but for this type of problem, let\u0026rsquo;s try something different, shall we?\nI want to show you a better way: use Arel to generate the statements for you.\nFollow along and you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to do it.\nExample Let\u0026rsquo;s suppose you have a simple schema containing users, posts and comments:\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do create_table :posts, force: true do |t| end create_table :users, force: true do |t| t.string :country end create_table :comments, force: true do |t| t.integer :post_id t.integer :user_id end end The models would look something like this:\nclass Post \u0026lt; ActiveRecord::Base has_many :comments end class User \u0026lt; ActiveRecord::Base has_many :comments end class Comment \u0026lt; ActiveRecord::Base belongs_to :post belongs_to :user end Normally, you\u0026rsquo;d order a post\u0026rsquo;s comments by their creation date. That\u0026rsquo;s the simple case.\nHowever, the simple case is seldom enough. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you need to order comments by something more complicated than that:\n The current_user\u0026rsquo;s comments should come first; Followed by comments created by people who live in the same country as the current_user.  Your first instinct might be to write a raw SQL query. See how this is done on the next section.\nHow to write an order by case statement with raw SQL If you try to do a simple raw SQL query, you could write an order-by case stamement based on the user\u0026rsquo;s id and country.\nHowever, if you allow people to store any type of string on their user.country field, you would also need to sanitize the query to prevent SQL injections.\nLet me tell you something: sanitizing case-statements is annoying, specially for order by statements.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how that would look like:\n# sad-face case_statement = \u0026lt;\u0026lt;-SQL.squish  CASE WHEN users.id = ? THEN 1 WHEN users.country = ? then 2 ELSE 3 END SQL # country could be anything, so let\u0026#39;s sanitize the query: sanitized_case_statement = ActiveRecord::Base.sanitize_sql_array( [case_statement, user.id, user.country] ) post.comments .joins(:user, :post) .order( Arel.sql(sanitized_case_statement) ) Which is not the cleanest-looking code.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve read this far, you\u0026rsquo;re probably thinking: \u0026ldquo;Is there a better way?\u0026quot; Absolutely! Enter Arel.\nHow to Write a Clean Order By Case Statement with Arel Arel supports case-statements, a not well-known feature.\nUse it to generate a complex order by case statement query. Better yet, you won\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about sanitization.\nThe idea is to leverage Arel::Nodes::Case to build the SQL expression. Here\u0026rsquo;s how:\nusers = User.arel_table same_user = users[:id].eq(current_user.id) same_country = users[:country].eq(current_user.country) case_statement = Arel::Nodes::Case.new .when(same_user).then(1) .when(same_country).then(2) .else(3) post.comments.joins(:user, :post).order(case_statement) Much cleaner, right?\nYou could even write subqueries to expose more information and add them to your case-statement.\nThen, you can break things down into scopes, or refactor pieces of the query into a Query Object. That gives you more flexibility and the code will be a little easier to extend and maintain.\nTake a look at this gist to see the full example plus tests if you\u0026rsquo;d like to try it out.\nAnd there you have it: a clean way to write case-when statements on complex order_by queries with ruby code.

If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a good reason to keep Sprockets around, don\u0026rsquo;t.\n Most apps can just use Webpacker. In case you\u0026rsquo;re wondering, Webpacker is just a wrapper around Webpack, which is a tool responsible for bundling assets. It takes care of static assets (Javascript, CSS, even images and fonts), and it\u0026rsquo;s a more complete solution, altough a little harder to get used to.\nAdvantages of Webpack(er):\n You can easily import npm packages to take care of your frontend needs There are way more tutorials about how to set up a Javascript library using Webpack that you can adapt Most tools from the JS ecosystem will target Webpack users anywway You\u0026rsquo;ll only need to debug one asset bundling tool instead of two!  If we take a look at what the Elixir folks are doing, they use Webpack by default on Phoenix Applications. This is great because it keeps things straightforward, specially when you need to debug something.\nThere are two situations in which you should be careful before making this decision:\n You have a large legacy Rails application with a complicated frontend that depends heavily on Sprockets. See section Huge Legacy Apps below to learn more. Your project is split into multiple Rails engines that expose any sort of theme, Javascript or other static assets. This is tricky. You might need to create an npm package and refactor some Javascript code, which can be a lot of work (see this discussion on the rails forum).

Should I run data and schema modifications in one database migration? Should I run rake scripts in production to modify data? Should I use a specialized data migration gem?  You will get different answers depending on whom you ask. Some people will tell you that changing data with a database migration is an anti-pattern and migrations should only contain schema changes.\nBut isn\u0026rsquo;t the whole point of a migration to be a good way to define a point-in-time transition of database structure or data, using code?\nIf you have a larger application or a mission-critical system, you should be careful about how you update production data, as this can lead to downtime and big problems. This post won\u0026rsquo;t cover this scenario.\nHowever, if your app is still relatively new and small, this post is for you. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can use data migrations to change production data without shooting yourself in the foot.\n1. Schema changes and data changes are like water and oil: they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t hangout together Write data manipulation code in separate Rails migrations and give them proper names. NEVER change schema and data in the same migration.\nAnother tip: consider separating complicated migrations and code changes in multiple pull requests you can merge and deploy separately. That way you can incrementally change the database and catch errors or rollback more easily.\n2. Stick to plain old SQL, if you can Careful when using models in migrations. It\u0026rsquo;s better to just write data manipulation as Arel or plain SQL queries and not use models at all, because if you change the model, your old migrations might break.\nSQL is independent from ActiveRecord model\u0026rsquo;s definitions, queries won\u0026rsquo;t trigger callbacks, and most importantly: any future code changes to a model won\u0026rsquo;t cause you a world of pain.\nWell-written SQL queries can be really fast. Just be careful and make sure you\u0026rsquo;re updating the right things.\nAlways ask yourself: Am I missing a where statement here somewhere?\nSee this nice example from Discourse of a simple data migration:\nclass MigrateAtDesktopBookmarkReminders \u0026lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0] def up DB.exec( \u0026lt;\u0026lt;~SQL, now: Time.zone.now UPDATE bookmarks SET reminder_type = NULL, reminder_at = NULL, updated_at = :now WHERE reminder_type = 0 SQL ) end def down # add some code to revert this migration, if possible end end 3. Strong Migrations (optional) Consider adding the strong_migrations gem to your project and following its suggestions as much as possible. These guidelines will help you catch unsafe migration code during development and teach you some good practices.\nPay special attention to the warnings related to adding indexes and default values to existing columns, as this can cause downtime.\nDoing these things will put you in a good spot and make your life easier in the future.\n  ","permalink":"https://www.thd.codes/posts/rails-data-migrations/","summary":"You need to change production data.

You can also go to Advanced Options and check all the applications you need. Also, make sure to add an EC2 key pair so you can connect to it with ssh.\nThen, after your cluster is running, connect to it via ssh:\n$ ssh -i [path-to-your-ec2-keypair].pem hadoop@[some-address].compute.amazonaws.com Then run this command to install the jdbc interpreter:\n$ sudo /usr/lib/zeppelin/bin/install-interpreter.sh --name jdbc \u0026gt; Interpreter jdbc installed under /usr/lib/zeppelin/interpreter/jdbc. Restart Zeppelin by running these commands:\n$ sudo stop zeppelin \u0026gt; zeppelin stop/waiting $ sudo start zeppelin \u0026gt; zeppelin start/running, process 24434 PROTIP: this step can also be run as a bootstrap-action for convenience. EMR allows you to define a bash script that is run when creating your EMR cluster and it will be executed when each node is started, once on the master node and once on all the slave nodes. You can define bootstrap actions before creating the EMR cluster.\nNow, in order to run a query, you need to configure the Zeppelin interpreter. To access Zeppelin notebook, first you need to open an ssh tunnel to your EMR cluster and configure a proxy that will safely access the cluster through the ssh tunnel.\nConnecting to EMR with FoxyProxy 6.x In order to access the web tools on your EMR cluster, you need to configure the Web Connection. Go to Amazon EMR \u0026gt; Clusters \u0026gt; click on the cluster you just created, then click on Enable Web Connection. This will explain how to set up an ssh tunnel and configure foxyproxy.\nTo set up the tunnel on port 8157, run:\nssh -i ~/emr-key.pem -ND 8157 hadoop@[master-public-dns-of-your-cluster] Then you need to configure a proxy management tool. The tutorial description on amazon explains how to set up foxyproxy, but this is not up-to-date because foxyproxy doesn\u0026rsquo;t support XML configurations anymore, so you\u0026rsquo;re gonna need to use a json config. To do that, copy this configuration example here and save it as foxyproxy-config.json.\nThen, follow these steps:\n Install the FoxyProxy add-on, then click on the FoxyProxy icon on the top right corner of firefox click on Import On the first section Import Settings from FoxyProxy 6.x (current version), click on Browse Select foxyproxy-config.json and confirm. You\u0026rsquo;re gonna see a new proxy configuration on the foxyproxy list called EMR SOCKS Proxy. Enable the proxy by clicking on the foxyproxy icon on the top right corner of your browser and select Use proxy EMR SOCKS Proxy for all URLs (ignore patterns)  Now you should be able to access any of the web application interfaces running on your EMR cluster, like Zeppelin, Ganglia, and YARN. You can see a list of them here.\nTo access Zeppelin, go to http://[master-public-dns-of-your-cluster]:8890/.\nConfigure Database Connections  On Zeppelin, go to Interpreters http://[master-public-dns-of-your-cluster]:8890/#/interpreter. Click on + Create to configure a new Interpreter Give it a name (like jdbc) to be used on your notes as %jdbc Choose JDBC as the interpreter group Configure the connection properties, like default.url, default.password, default.user and default.driver (if needed) to access your database.  The interesting thing about the JDBC interpreter is that you can define multiple connections to any different type of database by using a prefix instead of the default one and defining an appropriate driver, as described here. As an example, I wanted to connect to three different PostgreSQL databases, so I configured my connections as following:\nDatabase DB1\ndb1.url -\u0026gt; jdbc:postgresql://db1-url:5432/db-name1 (string) db1.password -\u0026gt; ******* (password) db1.user -\u0026gt; db1user (string) db1.driver -\u0026gt; org.postgresql.Driver (string) Database DB2\ndb2.url -\u0026gt; jdbc:postgresql://db2-url:5432/db-name2 (string) db2.password -\u0026gt; ******* (password) db2.user -\u0026gt; db2user (string) db2.driver -\u0026gt; org.postgresql.Driver (string) And so on. The JDBC interpreter uses the driver and the connection details to access the database in a generic way, so it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to connect to any kind of database and use the same querying interface. In order to use a different connection on your notebook, you define the interpreter and add a prefix, like so:\n%jdbc(db1) SHOW TABLES; %jdbc(db2) SHOW TABLES; Running Queries To use the generic JDBC interpreter, create a new zeppelin note.

You\u0026rsquo;re going to spend a huge amount of time tuning your database, reading query plans, adding indexes, sharding, and slowly moving data around until you have something decent that take hours, days, maybe weeks to run. Trust me, I\u0026rsquo;ve been there.\nBesides, indexing millions of documents on elasticsearch is also complicated, you have to spin up lots of new nodes even when you don\u0026rsquo;t really need to scale your cluster right away. In my case, I just needed fast and efficient bulk indexing, searching and filtering don\u0026rsquo;t need to be super fast because data velocity is not a problem yet, but volume is. Tuning bulk indexing and optimizing memory usage on elasticsearch is not fun either.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m an impatient developer, and I need my stuff right now. The only way to do that is by liberating the data and moving it to a large hadoop cluster.\nNowadays, with Amazon EMR (Elastic Map Reduce) and spot instances, it\u0026rsquo;s really, really cheap to just spin up a cluster with hundreds of nodes and run your big data processing job in a very cost-efficient way. And you don\u0026rsquo;t even have to manage it, EMR has templates with pre-installed tools, like Apache Sqoop, Spark and Hadoop.\n  light speed is too slow, we\u0026rsquo;re gonna have to go right to Ludicrous Speed!\n  Why you should consider this approach? It\u0026rsquo;s really cheap! I have a couple of jobs that are memory-heavy, and I run them on Spark. One of them runs on a cluster with 41 r4.2xlarge instances, each one of them has 8 vCPUS and 61GB of memory, so that\u0026rsquo;s a total of 328 CPUs and 2.5Tb of memory. Neat, huh?\nThey\u0026rsquo;re all spot instances that I can rent and pay $0.14 per hour, so running the cluster costs $6 dollars per hour :moneybag::moneybag::moneybag:. It may look like a lot, but here\u0026rsquo;s the cool thing about it: my job runs in about 30 minutes. After that, I just kill the cluster.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really fast! Compared to the process we had before (SQL, logstash, some elixir code, and some bash scripts), I calculated it would take more than a month to run the whole thing and index all the data (yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s very slow). And this is assuming that one server would even be able to handle it (I bet it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t), and I\u0026rsquo;m not even considering the time it would take me to fix and optimize the whole process just to make it run properly and consistently.\nAmazon even has a service right now called AWS Glue that abstracts away the whole cluster thing, so you just pay by the hour to run your Spark jobs, pretty much like Lambda. And if you prefer Google cloud, they also have some options too.\nIn my case, I can spin up the EMR cluster and let it crunch some terabytes of data while I brew my coffee, and spend just $6 dollars. That\u0026rsquo;s a huge improvement for an impatient dev like myself. After all, time is a very precious thing.\nSometimes running Hadoop and Spark is overkill, but for this problem it was a no-brainer: one person can build the whole map-reduce job and manage the cluster easily, and just move the final data to S3 when finished. So if you have a problem like that, you should seriously consider if a proper big data tool could be a better solution than your current one.\n","permalink":"https://www.thd.codes/posts/elasticsearch-indexing-with-spark-overview/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been building the data infrastructure for a project and I needed to efficiently query, merge, process and clean terabytes of structured data and then index hundreds of millions of documents on elasticsearch.\nThe problem is that querying and joining data on a RDBMS like Postgres is very painful when you have more than low terabytes of data.
