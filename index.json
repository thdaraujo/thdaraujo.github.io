[{"content":"One of my readers asked:\n How do you get started when you join a new company? How do you add features to a codebase that is massive, scary, and completely new to you?\n The first day at your new developer job is just like the first day at a new school. üö∏\nA sea of stranger\u0026rsquo;s faces watching your every move. Unfamiliar smells in the hallway.\nEvery chair is uncomfortable and makes weird noises when you sit. \u0026ldquo;Eek, there\u0026rsquo;s chewed-up gum under the seat!\u0026quot;\nThe cafeteria, as expected, serves undrinkable coffee.\nJust like the first zoom meeting with your new team.\nAre they friendly and cool people? Will they think your code sucks? What about that Github link they\u0026rsquo;ve just sent you? Urgh, look at all that foreign code!\nYour first day at your new job can be quite scary.\nBut what if you could feel confident, supported, respected, and comfortable collaborating with your new team? What if you knew how to find your way around any codebase?\nWhat if you could be so focused and productive that you don\u0026rsquo;t even notice time passing? Your working day goes like a breeze!\nAfter you read this post, you will know what strategies to use so you feel comfortable and know exactly how and where to get started üåü\nBefore You Join, Take Time Off This might not be possible in every situation. Do your best to take some time for yourself.\nTake some time off before you start at a new job. Two weeks at the very least. Take this opportunity to start fresh and spend a couple of weeks relaxing and clearing your head.\nHaving this extra headspace will help on your first week as you learn new things and get to know your teammates.\nThe reason you feel so tired on your first week even has a scientific name: it\u0026rsquo;s called Acculturation. It\u0026rsquo;s hard for anyone.\nCompanies might try to pressure you into starting as soon as possible, but it\u0026rsquo;s always your choice. Assertive communication and taking care of yourself are qualities of a confident software engineer.\nAsk for Onboarding Materials or Documentation Ask if the company has any kind of onboarding materials you can look at the day before you join. Try to learn more about the stack, the codebase, and how the team works.\nFor a startup, it\u0026rsquo;s always good to look at their pitch deck so you can understand the problem they are solving and what kind of customers they are serving.\nSome companies won\u0026rsquo;t be able to share anything with you before your first day for confidential or security reasons, while others might.\nIn the past, one of my colleagues was given access to our codebase and got paid to work on it as part of the interview, which is a very neat way to get people onboarded more easily.\nOnboarding Buddy   When your onboarding buddy is SpongeBob SquarePants\n  When the company has some form of onboarding process plus good documentation, it makes things so much easier. Take advantage of it.\nHaving an onboarding buddy helps a lot in your first few weeks, as you get to know your team, the company\u0026rsquo;s culture, how the product helps customers, and how people collaborate.\nHaving someone to talk to and support you on your first week is very important.\nThis onboarding buddy should also help you set up your dev environment. If there\u0026rsquo;s no onboarding process in place, you can always ask for an onboarding buddy. Help them understand the value of good onboarding and get the ball rolling.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve managed the onboarding process for one of my past employers and we\u0026rsquo;ve onboarded dozens of software engineers. Every one of them said that having a good onboarding process made them feel much more confident, welcomed, and productive.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s no go-to person to ask your questions, or you don\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable asking for someone to help you in your first few weeks, read on. There are a couple of other things you can try.\nUpdate the documentation and onboarding materials (optional) When you are getting started, it\u0026rsquo;s always good to update the documentation being used for onboarding. It\u0026rsquo;s often out-of-date, so it\u0026rsquo;s a good opportunity to make things better for yourself and your team in the future.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s an easy way to show your peers you are a team player and you are committed to making things better for everyone.\nIssues and Feature Requests: Make Sure You Understand Them First and foremost, you have to understand what a new feature is supposed to do, and what would it mean for it to be \u0026ldquo;done and complete.\u0026rdquo; Teams often have different interpretations of done.\nFor some, \u0026lsquo;done\u0026rsquo; means \u0026lsquo;tested and shipped to production\u0026rsquo;. Other times it just means \u0026lsquo;ready for QA\u0026rsquo;.\nWork with the person that created the issue or feature request to make sure you understand it well.\nNot every team is good at writing and explaining things well on paper. Trying to understand what you need to do just by looking at the issue description or feature request can be challenging. You will be missing a lot of context as a new member of the team.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions if you\u0026rsquo;re not sure what needs to be done, and take notes. Updating the issue/feature description always helps.\nWrite well, be kind to your future self.\nI love writing good and descriptive user stories even if it\u0026rsquo;s just for me to read. They help me a lot a week from now when I don\u0026rsquo;t even remember what I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to build. Happens all the time. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\nLatest Merged Pull Requests: A Gold Mine of Information After trying the usual stuff such as looking at the documentation and potentially outdated READMEs, you can move on to the next step:\nLook at the latest merged Pull Requests\nOne thing that helps the most is going through the latest merged pull requests and seeing what happened and how they look.\nThis is the best way to see how people approach building new features on your team. Pull Requests usually have linked issues or feature requests you can read as well.\nThis shows which parts/modules/classes/files in the system usually need to be changed in order to ship feature X or Y.\nFor example: let\u0026rsquo;s say the latest PR shipped the orders endpoint.\nYou look at the diff, you might see this:\n a new database migration a new model a new controller a new policy changes to the routes.rb file a new serializer and/or views new tests: feature tests, request tests, model tests, etc. a new factory documentation updates etc.  Sometimes a feature touches infrastructure code as well (terraform files, CI stuff). Some teams ship database migrations in a separate PR.\nLooking at the diff/code changes helps you see what needs to be done.\nCollaboration You will also get a sense of how the team works.\nFor example, you might get answers to these technical aspects:\n How much test coverage is good enough? What\u0026rsquo;s the coding style people follow? What are the conventions and best practices being followed? Which libraries are being used? Which patterns are being used and how code is organized? Do people open large Pull Requests or small ones? Do people split changes into frontend and backend changes? Is the project organized as a monorepo or a multi-repo? How does the CI/CD look like? How code gets deployed (manual vs automated deployments)? How and when do database migrations get merged? Does the team refactor code and pay down technical debt? When?  You will learn how people give feedback. How much do they nitpick on the small stuff. How much bikeshedding is allowed. How technical discussions are conducted.\nSome teams care about good architecture and design. Others like to do incremental changes, refactoring, and paying down technical debt when needed. While others don\u0026rsquo;t really care about any of this stuff and prefer to move fast and break things.\nThese are useful things to know and expect when you submit your first PR. That will give you more confidence.\nTake a peek at routes.rb One simple trick is to look at config/routes.rb first. Routes give you a sense of the endpoints and features that are available without having to go too deep into the codebase.\nBy looking at the routes, you will know if the project has an external API or not, which is very useful information.\nRead Related Code Take a look at code related to the feature you\u0026rsquo;re working on. Models, Controllers, and the Schema or related migrations are good places to look.\nLet the Team Help You: Submit Your PR and Ask for Feedback Your new team wants you to be successful. That\u0026rsquo;s why they hired you in the first place: because you\u0026rsquo;re a great developer and you kick ass!\nLet them help you be successful.\nYou can always submit your PR as is and wait for feedback. Let people help you finish it. You\u0026rsquo;ll never know everything up front, there\u0026rsquo;s no point in trying to make it perfect on the first try.\nIf you get stuck, ask for help. Let people help you! There\u0026rsquo;s no shame in that.\nRemember to add enough context in the Pull Request description so people can understand what you are trying to do.\nHow to receive feedback Constructive feedback is always valuable. Listening to constructive criticism is how you learn and get better.\n Ask: what can I learn from the feedback I\u0026rsquo;ve received?\n Ask questions so you can understand their point of view. Be curious and open-minded.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry too much if people request changes or point to you things that could be improved. Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to make mistakes.\n Ask: did I add enough context in the Pull Request description?\n Sometimes they don\u0026rsquo;t have enough context into what you are doing. In that case, add more context to help them.\nSometimes they have a point and they are right. Be flexible and open, as they are giving you feedback so the team can ship good code. They could be asking you to follow some of the team\u0026rsquo;s conventions that you might not know of.\nOther times, the reviewer just thinks differently than you. This is also fine. No two developers would ever write code in the same manner or style all the time. For these types of requests for change, you can politely disagree.\nWith time you will learn how to separate changes that are \u0026ldquo;nice to have\u0026rdquo; but don\u0026rsquo;t make any real difference, and changes that are really important.\nHaving integrity and being assertive are hallmarks of a confident coder. Be graceful when receiving feedback. Even if people do criticize you for no good reason, don\u0026rsquo;t take it personally.\nBe kind, be gentle, and remember: your work does not define your value as a person.\nAsking questions is an effective way to change your approach to receiving criticism. By asking a question, you stop judging yourself or others, and you start to be more curious.\nThe Confident Developer Onboarding Checklist Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick checklist you can use for self-onboarding ‚úÖ\n Ask for some time off before I start Ask for documentation or onboarding materials Take advantage of the onboarding process Find an onboarding buddy Understand the issue or feature request I\u0026rsquo;m working on Look at the latest merged Pull Requests Take a peek at the routes.rb file, or any code related to my work Let the team help me Get out of code perfectionism paralysis Ask for feedback Learn from the received feedback  If you have other ideas that helped you in the past and want me to add them here, please let me know! üí°\n Hope you apply these strategies to give you more confidence in your first few weeks at your new developer job.\nPrint your checklist and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to use it!

How do you even get started?"},{"content":"Are you having a hard time picking up the syntax of a new programming language, even though you know how to code?\nYou\u0026rsquo;re new to Ruby, and people say it\u0026rsquo;s an easy language, but you find the syntax difficult to understand.\nYou know a bit of Javascript, Python, Java, or any other language. But Ruby seems like alien technology to you.\nBy the end of this post, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a tool to help you transfer your knowledge of [INSERT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE HERE] to Ruby.\nRuby is all about messages and objects Ruby is all about objects sending messages to other objects. It\u0026rsquo;s a slightly different way of thinking.\nRuby is similar to languages like Smalltalk and Lisp. They\u0026rsquo;re very flexible languages based on a small number of basic building blocks.\nThat flexibility allows you to make your code very readable and descriptive. Almost like writing English text.\nLearn the Basic Building Blocks To learn the syntax and the style of a new language, you should understand the basic building blocks of the new language you want to learn and compare them to another one you understand well.\nThen you can try to translate a small piece of code from one language that you understand well to another you\u0026rsquo;re trying to learn.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how you spot their differences and similarities and understand how to apply these ideas in different scenarios.\nThis is something similar to Transfer Learning, or Knowledge Transfer.\nYou can use the knowledge you already have about how one language works, and use that to help you pick up the syntax of another language.\nGot it? Let\u0026rsquo;s practice!\nHow to transfer coding knowledge from one language to another Here\u0026rsquo;s an exercise you can use to transfer knowledge from one language to another.\n1. Start with a simple problem Always start with a simple problem you can easily solve with just a few lines of code in the original language.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume you know Golang.\nHow would you write a piece of code that prints numbers from 1 up to 10 in Go and Ruby?\nMaybe something like this:\nGo:\n// Go for i := 1; i \u0026lt;= 10; i++ { fmt.Println(i) } This is one way you could do it in Ruby:\n# Ruby (1..10).each do |n| puts n end 2. Identify similarities and differences between the basic building blocks What are the big differences you can spot at first glance? Do you see any differences in style?\nIn the Ruby example, here are some of the basic building blocks we can spot:\n a range 1..10 the usage of an each iterator instead of a for-loop a block do ... end with a parameter n a puts n method called with one argument and no parenthesis  3. Ask yourself some questions Here are a couple of suggested questions you can start with:\n Ruby has for loops, but why are we iterating over a range here? Is each a method call on range? Why are we using do |n| ... end instead of { |n| ... }? What if you change the code to puts(n)?  You could even ask a slightly harder question:\n Would you be able to send a message to a variable in Go?  This is how you can send a message to an object in Ruby:\n# sending a message instead of calling a method (1..10).send(:each) { |n| puts n } Do you see what I mean?\nConclusion To recap:\n pick a simple problem you can easily solve with just a few lines of code in the original language solve the problem by writing code in a language you know well solve the problem by using the new language you want to learn try to spot the basic building blocks, styles, and patterns in both pieces of code compare both implementations to see any differences and similarities ask yourself some questions and try to answer them  You can learn a lot about Ruby (or any other language) just by trying to answer one of these questions above.\nAnd then trying to write a similar piece of code by yourself in the new language so you can practice what you just learned.\nYou will learn not only the style and syntax of Ruby but also the mindset behind it.\nThis exercise will help you pick up any other programming language. Change the questions a bit and practice.\nNow go practice!\n  Did you like this article? Then you're gonna love these other ones:\n  New job, new codebase. How do you even get started?

What are you supposed to do with all of that?\nThe problem is that it\u0026rsquo;s not actionable information, just a bunch of ideas and vague suggestions.\nThere is a more practical way to learn all this stuff. Here\u0026rsquo;s how.\nOne Exercise to Teach You Ruby on Rails Best Practices Instead of reading another book or watching youtube videos about pasta making during your lunch break, do this exercise instead:\nExercise  Set a timer for 10 minutes. Open this link in another tab: practice.rb from Upcase by Thoughtbot Read the app/services/practice.rb class. Ask yourself: What\u0026rsquo;s going on here? Come back here when the time is up! ‚åõ  Sounds good?\nOkay, now go do it! I\u0026rsquo;ll wait for you.\n\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\n\u0026hellip;\n‚è∞ beep! beep! beep! beep!\nNow that the time is up, answer at least one of these questions:\n Why is this class so short? It\u0026rsquo;s less than a hundred lines! Why is the variable trails being passed down to the initialize constructor? Did you notice these methods promoted_unstarted_trails and unpromoted_unstarted_trails? Why do you think they were given these names, and what\u0026rsquo;s the difference between them? What is this class responsible for? ü§î What else picked your interest?  Write down the questions and your answers to make them stick.\nLast but not least:\n Repeat this exercise tomorrow, but pick a different class from the same repository. Add a daily reminder to your calendar so you don\u0026rsquo;t forget about it. üìÖ  It\u0026rsquo;s okay if you don\u0026rsquo;t understand anything The goal of this exercise is to notice some patterns. Not to understand every single line of code.\nUse your answers to the questions above as a study guide. Even if you answered \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s useful information.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s okay if you feel uncomfortable Feeling uncomfortable means you\u0026rsquo;re doing something different. You\u0026rsquo;re challenging yourself. You\u0026rsquo;re learning and growing.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re thinking \u0026ldquo;OMG this code is too clean and my code is super dirty!\u0026quot; or \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll never be able to work on such a clean codebase!\u0026quot;, don\u0026rsquo;t worry!\nThat\u0026rsquo;s okay. That\u0026rsquo;s not the point of this exercise.\nThe point of this exercise is to read the code and notice anything that looks different or any interesting pattern.\nFrequently Asked Questions Here are the answers to some questions you might have about this exercise.\nHow am I going to learn anything just by reading one class? It might seem like it\u0026rsquo;s not much.\nIf you do this every day, here\u0026rsquo;s what\u0026rsquo;s going to happen:\n At the very least, you\u0026rsquo;re going to learn how the Upcase codebase works. You will pick up new ideas and patterns. You will end up with a list of things you don\u0026rsquo;t understand. That\u0026rsquo;s a great guide on what you need to focus on. You will see how other experts structure a project to make the code neat and clean. You will learn how to find answers to your own questions and how to read source code.  That\u0026rsquo;s pretty good, right?\nAll professional developers and experts have these skills. It comes from practice.\nWhy Pick a Well-Written Codebase? Good question. You have to be exposed to good code if you want to advance your skills. Especially if you don\u0026rsquo;t have this opportunity at work.\nIf your goal is to learn best practices, you have to read a well-written codebase.\nThoughtbot, the company behind Upcase, is well-known in the Ruby on Rails community for setting industry standards and following good coding practices.\nWhat if I get stuck? When that happens, ask one of your colleagues for help.\nIf that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work or you don\u0026rsquo;t feel comfortable doing that, ask Rails Forum or Reddit.\nYou can also send me a DM on Twitter and I\u0026rsquo;ll be happy to help.\nCan you give me other examples of questions to ask? I\u0026rsquo;m glad you asked!\nSome other interesting questions you may ask:\n What does this class/object afford? What is the potential action enabled by this class/object? What are the dependencies of this class? How would I feel if I had to use this class (happy, angry, confused)? Why is this code here and not somewhere else? If I call this method, how much do I need to know about its implementation?  Be curious.\nEven when you think you know something well, challenge your knowledge about it by asking interesting questions.\nIt can be hard to separate understanding from memory or just familiarity.\nSometimes you think you understand a concept because it\u0026rsquo;s familiar to you. You remember it vividly. But you\u0026rsquo;re not able to explain the idea to anyone, even to yourself. And that\u0026rsquo;s not fun!\nIs there a list of projects I can use for this exercise? Sure thing! When you\u0026rsquo;re finished with Upcase, you can pick a different project to study.\nBut BEWARE: Analysis paralysis is a real thing, so be careful!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to procrastinate instead of doing real work and practicing.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t waste too much time choosing a project. Pick one at a time and keep practicing.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve compiled a list of projects and other resources to help you.\n Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve done this exercise, you will improve your Rails skills every time you practice.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of consistently exposing yourself to good code. Keep using the suggested questions as a guide, or come up with different ones. Pick a different class every day, and keep going.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve already done the hardest part: getting started. Now keep practicing.\nLet me know what you\u0026rsquo;ve learned by practicing this exercise.\nBookmark this post to keep the questions on hand. Share it with a friend who will find this exercise helpful. ‚≠ê\nHappy learnings! üìì\nPS: I recently gave a talk about this exercise, you can find the slides here üçù\n  Did you like this article?

You realize you\u0026rsquo;ll need to write a complex order by query\u0026hellip;\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how it usually goes:\n You think to yourself: \u0026ldquo;Should I write an order by case when statement? Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll just add a little bit of SQL\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; Two minutes later, you end up with a bunch of nested case when statements, subqueries, common table expressions, angry statements, shouting, and a whole lot of tears. üò§  If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever tried to write a complicated order by statement with ActiveRecord, you probably know that it\u0026rsquo;s kind of painful, and you end up with ugly-looking code. That\u0026rsquo;s not what you want, right?\nThat sort of query quickly becomes unreadable as you add more and more cases to it.\nMost examples and tutorials don\u0026rsquo;t even mention that you might need to sanitize your query\u0026hellip; Not cool!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s okay to write raw SQL queries sometimes, but for this type of problem, let\u0026rsquo;s try something different, shall we?\nI want to show you a better way: use Arel to generate the statements for you.\nFollow along and you\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to do it.\nExample Let\u0026rsquo;s suppose you have a simple schema containing users, posts and comments:\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do create_table :posts, force: true do |t| end create_table :users, force: true do |t| t.string :country end create_table :comments, force: true do |t| t.integer :post_id t.integer :user_id end end The models would look something like this:\nclass Post \u0026lt; ActiveRecord::Base has_many :comments end class User \u0026lt; ActiveRecord::Base has_many :comments end class Comment \u0026lt; ActiveRecord::Base belongs_to :post belongs_to :user end Normally, you\u0026rsquo;d order a post\u0026rsquo;s comments by their creation date. That\u0026rsquo;s the simple case.\nHowever, the simple case is seldom enough. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you need to order comments by something more complicated than that:\n The current_user\u0026rsquo;s comments should come first; Followed by comments created by people who live in the same country as the current_user.  Your first instinct might be to write a raw SQL query. See how this is done on the next section.\nHow to write an order by case statement with raw SQL If you try to do a simple raw SQL query, you could write an order-by case stamement based on the user\u0026rsquo;s id and country.\nHowever, if you allow people to store any type of string on their user.country field, you would also need to sanitize the query to prevent SQL injections.\nLet me tell you something: sanitizing case-statements is annoying, specially for order by statements.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how that would look like:\n# sad-face case_statement = \u0026lt;\u0026lt;-SQL.squish  CASE WHEN users.id = ? THEN 1 WHEN users.country = ? then 2 ELSE 3 END SQL # country could be anything, so let\u0026#39;s sanitize the query: sanitized_case_statement = ActiveRecord::Base.sanitize_sql_array( [case_statement, user.id, user.country] ) post.comments .joins(:user, :post) .order( Arel.sql(sanitized_case_statement) ) Which is not the cleanest-looking code.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve read this far, you\u0026rsquo;re probably thinking: \u0026ldquo;Is there a better way?\u0026quot; Absolutely! Enter Arel.\nHow to Write a Clean Order By Case Statement with Arel Arel supports case-statements, a not well-known feature.\nUse it to generate a complex order by case statement query. Better yet, you won\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about sanitization.\nThe idea is to leverage Arel::Nodes::Case to build the SQL expression. Here\u0026rsquo;s how:\nusers = User.arel_table same_user = users[:id].eq(current_user.id) same_country = users[:country].eq(current_user.country) case_statement = Arel::Nodes::Case.new .when(same_user).then(1) .when(same_country).then(2) .else(3) post.comments.joins(:user, :post).order(case_statement) Much cleaner, right?\nYou could even write subqueries to expose more information and add them to your case-statement.\nThen, you can break things down into scopes, or refactor pieces of the query into a Query Object. That gives you more flexibility and the code will be a little easier to extend and maintain.\nTake a look at this gist to see the full example plus tests if you\u0026rsquo;d like to try it out.\nAnd there you have it: a clean way to write case-when statements on complex order_by queries with ruby code.

This is great because it keeps things straightforward, specially when you need to debug something.\nWatch out for these two situations before making this decision:\n You have a large legacy Rails application with a complicated frontend that depends heavily on Sprockets. See section Huge Legacy Apps below to learn more. Your project is split into multiple Rails engines that expose any sort of theme, Javascript or other static assets. This is tricky. You might need to create an npm package and refactor some Javascript code, which can be a lot of work (see this discussion on the rails forum).

There was no open issue labeled as \u0026ldquo;good for beginners\u0026rdquo;, and we didn\u0026rsquo;t really want to work on an issue that was too simple (such as changing documentation), so we tried a different approach.\nWe looked for issues that had:\n a good description of the bug had reproduction steps written down had no open pull request available we could understand the problem without needing too much context about the codebase  We selected a couple of issues, and then decided to pick this one: Active Storage Disk Service NoMethodError: undefined method `rails_disk_service_url' related to ActiveStorage.\nThe first step was to try and reproduce the error by following the reproduction steps, which was possible.\nWe were able to run a Rails app that is just a single ruby file by using the bundler/inline feature.\nThis script will automatically install any missing gems, require the gems you listed, and then run your code. Pretty cool, right?\nThen we tried one of the solutions that someone commented, but we were not able to fix the problem. So we created a gist showing what happened and asking for feedback and more information. That was the end of the livestream!\nDuring the week, we got some more answers and ideas. One of the problems was that we were using the wrong ruby version (2.7 vs 3.x), and that fixed our problem.\nNow have a little bit more context (from this comment and this other comment).\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start writing some code to implement a fix.

Should I run data and schema modifications in one database migration? Should I run rake scripts in production to modify data? Should I use a specialized data migration gem?  You will get different answers depending on whom you ask. Some people will tell you that changing data with a database migration is an anti-pattern and migrations should only contain schema changes.\nBut isn\u0026rsquo;t the whole point of a migration to be a good way to define a point-in-time transition of database structure or data, using code?\nIf you have a larger application or a mission-critical system, be careful with production data updates. This can lead to downtime and big problems. This post won\u0026rsquo;t cover this scenario.\nHowever, if your app is still relatively new and small, this post is for you. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can use data migrations to change production data without shooting yourself in the foot.\n1. Schema changes and data changes are like water and oil: they do not hangout together Write data manipulation code in separate Rails migrations and give them proper names. NEVER change schema and data in the same migration.\nAnother tip: consider separating complicated migrations and code changes in multiple pull requests you can merge and deploy separately. That way you can incrementally change the database and catch errors or rollback more easily.\n2. Stick to plain old SQL, if you can Careful when using models in migrations. It\u0026rsquo;s better to just write data manipulation as Arel or plain SQL queries and not use models at all, because if you change the model, your old migrations might break.\nSQL is independent from ActiveRecord model\u0026rsquo;s definitions, queries won\u0026rsquo;t trigger callbacks, and most importantly: any future code changes to a model won\u0026rsquo;t cause you a world of pain.\nWell-written SQL queries can be really fast. Just be careful and make sure you\u0026rsquo;re updating the right things.\nAlways ask yourself: Am I missing a where statement here somewhere?\nSee this nice example from Discourse of a simple data migration:\nclass MigrateAtDesktopBookmarkReminders \u0026lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0] def up DB.exec( \u0026lt;\u0026lt;~SQL, now: Time.zone.now UPDATE bookmarks SET reminder_type = NULL, reminder_at = NULL, updated_at = :now WHERE reminder_type = 0 SQL ) end def down # add some code to revert this migration, if possible end end 3. Strong Migrations (optional) Consider adding the strong_migrations gem to your project and following its suggestions as much as possible. These guidelines will help you catch unsafe migration code during development and teach you some good practices.\nPay special attention to the warnings related to adding indexes and default values to existing columns, as this can cause downtime.\nDoing these things will put you in a good spot and make your life easier in the future.\n  Did you like this article?

You can also go to Advanced Options and check all the applications you need. Also, make sure to add an EC2 key pair so you can connect to it with ssh.\nThen, after your cluster is running, connect to it via ssh:\n$ ssh -i [path-to-your-ec2-keypair].pem hadoop@[some-address].compute.amazonaws.com Then run this command to install the jdbc interpreter:\n$ sudo /usr/lib/zeppelin/bin/install-interpreter.sh --name jdbc \u0026gt; Interpreter jdbc installed under /usr/lib/zeppelin/interpreter/jdbc. Restart Zeppelin by running these commands:\n$ sudo stop zeppelin \u0026gt; zeppelin stop/waiting $ sudo start zeppelin \u0026gt; zeppelin start/running, process 24434 PROTIP: this step can also be run as a bootstrap-action for convenience. EMR allows you to define a bash script that is run when creating your EMR cluster and it will be executed when each node is started, once on the master node and once on all the slave nodes. You can define bootstrap actions before creating the EMR cluster.\nNow, in order to run a query, you need to configure the Zeppelin interpreter. To access Zeppelin notebook, first you need to open an ssh tunnel to your EMR cluster and configure a proxy that will safely access the cluster through the ssh tunnel.\nConnecting to EMR with FoxyProxy 6.x In order to access the web tools on your EMR cluster, you need to configure the Web Connection. Go to Amazon EMR \u0026gt; Clusters \u0026gt; click on the cluster you just created, then click on Enable Web Connection. This will explain how to set up an ssh tunnel and configure foxyproxy.\nTo set up the tunnel on port 8157, run:\nssh -i ~/emr-key.pem -ND 8157 hadoop@[master-public-dns-of-your-cluster] Then you need to configure a proxy management tool. The tutorial description on amazon explains how to set up foxyproxy, but this is not up-to-date because foxyproxy doesn\u0026rsquo;t support XML configurations anymore, so you\u0026rsquo;re gonna need to use a json config. To do that, copy this configuration example here and save it as foxyproxy-config.json.\nThen, follow these steps:\n Install the FoxyProxy add-on, then click on the FoxyProxy icon on the top right corner of firefox click on Import On the first section Import Settings from FoxyProxy 6.x (current version), click on Browse Select foxyproxy-config.json and confirm. You\u0026rsquo;re gonna see a new proxy configuration on the foxyproxy list called EMR SOCKS Proxy. Enable the proxy by clicking on the foxyproxy icon on the top right corner of your browser and select Use proxy EMR SOCKS Proxy for all URLs (ignore patterns)  Now you should be able to access any of the web application interfaces running on your EMR cluster, like Zeppelin, Ganglia, and YARN. You can see a list of them here.\nTo access Zeppelin, go to http://[master-public-dns-of-your-cluster]:8890/.\nConfigure Database Connections  On Zeppelin, go to Interpreters http://[master-public-dns-of-your-cluster]:8890/#/interpreter. Click on + Create to configure a new Interpreter Give it a name (like jdbc) to be used on your notes as %jdbc Choose JDBC as the interpreter group Configure the connection properties, like default.url, default.password, default.user and default.driver (if needed) to access your database.  The interesting thing about the JDBC interpreter is that you can define multiple connections to any different type of database by using a prefix instead of the default one and defining an appropriate driver, as described here. As an example, I wanted to connect to three different PostgreSQL databases, so I configured my connections as following:\nDatabase DB1\ndb1.url -\u0026gt; jdbc:postgresql://db1-url:5432/db-name1 (string) db1.password -\u0026gt; ******* (password) db1.user -\u0026gt; db1user (string) db1.driver -\u0026gt; org.postgresql.Driver (string) Database DB2\ndb2.url -\u0026gt; jdbc:postgresql://db2-url:5432/db-name2 (string) db2.password -\u0026gt; ******* (password) db2.user -\u0026gt; db2user (string) db2.driver -\u0026gt; org.postgresql.Driver (string) And so on. The JDBC interpreter uses the driver and the connection details to access the database in a generic way, so it\u0026rsquo;s pretty easy to connect to any kind of database and use the same querying interface. In order to use a different connection on your notebook, you define the interpreter and add a prefix, like so:\n%jdbc(db1) SHOW TABLES; %jdbc(db2) SHOW TABLES; Running Queries To use the generic JDBC interpreter, create a new zeppelin note. Then click on Settings (Interpreter Binding) and enable/bind the JDBC interpreter to your note. You just need to enable jdbc.\nThen, to use the interpreter you just created, create a new paragraph, and define the interpreter and the connection prefix you want to use:\n%jdbc(prefix) SELECT * FROM tableA; In my case:\n%jdbc(db1) SELECT * FROM client; Now you have a simple way to connect and explore different databases in a very simple way.

One of them runs on a cluster with 41 r4.2xlarge instances, each one of them has 8 vCPUS and 61GB of memory, so that\u0026rsquo;s a total of 328 CPUs and 2.5Tb of memory. Neat, huh?\nThey\u0026rsquo;re all spot instances that I can rent and pay $0.14 per hour, so running the cluster costs $6 dollars per hour :moneybag::moneybag::moneybag:. It may look like a lot, but here\u0026rsquo;s the cool thing about it: my job runs in about 30 minutes. After that, I just kill the cluster.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really fast! Compared to the process we had before (SQL, logstash, some elixir code, and some bash scripts), I calculated it would take more than a month to run the whole thing and index all the data (yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s very slow). And this is assuming that one server would even be able to handle it (I bet it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t), and I\u0026rsquo;m not even considering the time it would take me to fix and optimize the whole process just to make it run properly and consistently.\nAmazon even has a service right now called AWS Glue that abstracts away the whole cluster thing, so you just pay by the hour to run your Spark jobs, pretty much like Lambda. And if you prefer Google cloud, they also have some options too.\nIn my case, I can spin up the EMR cluster and let it crunch some terabytes of data while I brew my coffee, and spend just $6 dollars. That\u0026rsquo;s a huge improvement for an impatient dev like myself. After all, time is a very precious thing.\nSometimes running Hadoop and Spark is overkill, but for this problem it was a no-brainer: one person can build the whole map-reduce job and manage the cluster easily, and just move the final data to S3 when finished. So if you have a problem like that, you should seriously consider if a proper big data tool could be a better solution than your current one.\n  Did you like this article?

All I wanted was to play Super Mario Brothers and Street Fighter with my cousin. Even Mortal Kombat, if I could get my hands on it.\nFor kids nowadays, getting a new videogame console is kind of straightforward: be a good kid, convince your parents to go on BestBuy and order a Nintendo Switch or a Playstation for you.\nBut back then, my friends, things were very, very different. Specially for a kid living in Sao Paulo.\nNot just because videogames were super expensive (they were!). Even if you were rich, you just couldn\u0026rsquo;t buy games at all. Or printers. Or desktop computers. No one could buy a piece of high-tech equipment, because these kinds of imports were heavily restricted.\nYou could only buy computers made in Brazil.\nWell, let\u0026rsquo;s see\u0026hellip; Sega is from Japan. Nintendo is from Japan. Sony is from Japan. Have you ever heard of a videogame console made by a brazilian company? Me neither.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re probably thinking: \u0026ldquo;well, too bad then\u0026hellip; No super-nintendos for that little guy!\u0026rdquo; Well, no kid would ever accept that fate, right?\nBut I had the perfect solution\u0026hellip; Let me tell you something about my father: my father was a smuggler\u0026hellip; of computers.\n This is a picture of my father from that time.\n[Lando Calrissian]\nJust kidding, this is Lando Calrissian, from Star Wars. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find an old picture of my father. But he\u0026rsquo;s kinda like Lando: they are both retired smugglers, and super awesome.\n My father looks just like Lando Calrissian from Star Wars, who is a retired smuggler that went around the galaxy transporting contraband. Just like my father.\nBut instead of disobeying the laws of the Galactic Republic, my father (and my mother) were violating the laws of the Republic of Brazil.\nThey would bring contraband from Paraguay, a small country close to Brazil and Argentina. Now, when I say contraband, it sounds pretty bad, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nBut it wasn\u0026rsquo;t: it was mostly computer parts, printers, things like that\u0026hellip; They used to sell desktop computers.\nWhen I asked for a Super Nintendo for my birthday, my father said: \u0026ldquo;okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll give you your birthday gift, but you have to come with me and bring it yourself.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s what happened. I got on a bus on friday night with dozens of other so-called smugglers.\nWe arrived at the border early in the morning. There\u0026rsquo;s a river that divides the two countries, and a bridge called \u0026ldquo;The Friendship Bridge\u0026rdquo;.\nYou could see thousands and thousands of merchants crossing that same bridge. They carried all sorts of goods from the other side of the border on giant bags and boxes.\nAfter we crossed the bridge, we went to this commercial neighborhood that was kind of dreamlike. An endless labyrinth of stores and street merchants speaking all sorts of different languages.\nYou could buy all kinds of goods: clothing, perfume, whisky, fake Disney toys and counterfeit Gucci handbags. But I wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in any of that.\nOn one of the stores, my father talked to this guy who was probably an old friend. This guy reached behind the counter for something\u0026hellip; And there it was: a large box, wrapped in brown paper.\nI knew exactly what was inside, even though I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen that box before. I took the box and wrapped my arm around it. I can\u0026rsquo;t really explain to you all the excitement I\u0026rsquo;ve felt in that moment.\nWe went back, and I\u0026rsquo;ve got to tell you: it was super scary. A mix of fear and excitement. I was scared that if we went trough customs, right at the border, they would confiscate my box or take it away from me.\nBut in the end, all went well. We got back to our bus. Twelve more hours to go, but I knew that tomorrow, on Sunday morning, I\u0026rsquo;d be playing Mario at home on my brand new Super Nintendo. I could not wait and I could not sleep.\nAnd this is how, my friends, I became a contrabandist for a day when I was 7 years old and smuggled a Super Nintendo for my birthday.\nThank you.\n","permalink":"https://www.thd.codes/posts/this-is-a-little-story-about-my-first-su/","summary":"This is a little story about my first super nintendo console, and how I became a smuggler (of videogames) just to get what I wanted.\nI wanted to share this fun and short story to let members of the group know a bit more about myself, my family, and my love for computers and videogames.\n When I was 7 years old in 1992, I had a simple dream: I wanted a Super Nintendo console for my birthday.","title":""},{"content":"Would you like to become an expert developer?
