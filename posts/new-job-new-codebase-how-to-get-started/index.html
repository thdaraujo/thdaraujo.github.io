How do you add features to a codebase that is massive, scary, and completely new to you?\n The first day at your new developer job is just like the first day at a new school. üö∏\nA sea of stranger‚Äôs faces watching your every move. Unfamiliar smells in the hallway.\nEvery chair is uncomfortable and makes weird noises when you sit. ‚ÄúEek, there‚Äôs chewed-up gum under the seat!\"\nThe cafeteria, as expected, serves undrinkable coffee.\nJust like the first zoom meeting with your new team.\nAre they friendly and cool people? Will they think your code sucks? What about that Github link they‚Äôve just sent you? Urgh, look at all that foreign code!\nYour first day at your new job can be quite scary.\nBut what if you could feel confident, supported, respected, and comfortable collaborating with your new team? What if you knew how to find your way around any codebase?\nWhat if you could be so focused and productive that you don‚Äôt even notice time passing? Your working day goes like a breeze!\nAfter you read this post, you will know what strategies to use so you feel comfortable and you will know exactly how to get started üåü\nBefore You Join, Take Time Off This might not be possible in every situation. Do your best to take some time for yourself.\nTake some time off before you start at a new job. Two weeks at the very least. Take this opportunity to start fresh and spend a couple of weeks relaxing and clearing your head.\nHaving this extra headspace will help on your first week as you learn new things and get to know your teammates.\nThe reason you feel so tired on your first week even has a scientific name: it‚Äôs called Acculturation. It‚Äôs hard for anyone.\nCompanies might try to pressure you into starting as soon as possible, but it‚Äôs always your choice. Assertive communication and taking care of yourself are qualities of a confident software engineer.\nAsk for Onboarding Materials or Documentation Ask if the company has any kind of onboarding materials you can look at the day before you join. Try to learn more about the stack, the codebase, and how the team works.\nFor a startup, it‚Äôs always good to look at their pitch deck so you can understand the problem they are solving and what kind of customers they are serving.\nSome companies won‚Äôt be able to share anything with you before your first day for confidential or security reasons, while others might.\nIn the past, one of my colleagues was given access to our codebase and got paid to work on it as part of the interview, which is a very neat way to get people onboarded more easily.\nOnboarding Buddy   When your onboarding buddy is Spongebob Squarepants\n  When the company has some form of onboarding process plus good documentation, it makes things so much easier. Take advantage of it.\nHaving an onboarding buddy helps a lot in your first few weeks, as you get to know your team, the company‚Äôs culture, how the product helps customers, and how people collaborate.\nHaving someone to talk to and support you on your first week is very important.\nThis onboarding buddy should also help you set up your dev environment. If there‚Äôs no onboarding process in place, you can always ask for an onboarding buddy. Help them understand the value of good onboarding and get the ball rolling.\nI‚Äôve managed the onboarding process for one of my past employers and we‚Äôve onboarded dozens of software engineers. Every one of them said that having a good onboarding process made them feel much more confident, welcomed, and productive.\nIf there‚Äôs no go-to person to ask your questions, or you don‚Äôt feel comfortable asking for someone to help you in your first few weeks, read on. There are a couple of other things you can try.\nUpdate the documentation and onboarding materials (optional) When you are getting started, it‚Äôs always good to update the documentation being used for onboarding. It‚Äôs often out-of-date, so it‚Äôs a good opportunity to make things better for yourself and your team in the future.\nThat‚Äôs an easy way to show your peers you are a team player and you are committed to making things better for everyone.\nIssues and Feature Requests: Make Sure You Understand Them First and foremost, you have to understand what a new feature is supposed to do, and what would it mean for it to be ‚Äúdone and complete.‚Äù Teams often have different interpretations of done.\nFor some, ‚Äòdone‚Äô means ‚Äòtested and shipped to production‚Äô. Other times it just means ‚Äòready for QA‚Äô.\nWork with the person that created the issue or feature request to make sure you understand it well.\nNot every team is good at writing and explaining things well on paper. Trying to understand what you need to do just by looking at the issue description or feature request can be challenging. You will be missing a lot of context as a new member of the team.\nDon‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions if you‚Äôre not sure what needs to be done, and take notes. Updating the issue/feature description always helps.\nWrite well, be kind to your future self.\nI love writing good and descriptive user stories even if it‚Äôs just for me to read. They help me a lot a week from now when I don‚Äôt even remember what I‚Äôm supposed to build. Happens all the time. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\nLatest Merged Pull Requests: A Gold Mine of Information After trying the usual stuff such as looking at the documentation and potentially outdated READMEs, you can move on to the next step:\nLook at the latest merged Pull Requests\nOne thing that helps the most is going through the latest merged pull requests and seeing what happened and how they look.\nThis is the best way to see how people approach building new features on your team. Pull Requests usually have linked issues or feature requests you can read as well.\nThis shows which parts/modules/classes/files in the system usually need to be changed in order to ship feature X or Y.\nFor example: let‚Äôs say the latest PR shipped the orders endpoint.\nYou look at the diff, you might see this:\n a new database migration a new model a new controller a new policy changes to the routes.rb file a new serializer and/or views new tests: feature tests, request tests, model tests, etc. a new factory documentation updates etc.  Sometimes a feature touches infrastructure code as well (terraform files, CI stuff). Some teams ship database migrations in a separate PR.\nLooking at the diff/code changes helps you see what needs to be done.\nCollaboration You will also get a sense of how the team works.\nFor example, you might get answers to these technical aspects:\n How much test coverage is good enough? What‚Äôs the coding style people follow? What are the conventions and best practices being followed? Which libraries are being used? Which patterns are being used and how code is organized? Do people open large Pull Requests or small ones? Do people split changes into frontend and backend changes? Is the project organized as a monorepo or a multi-repo? How does the CI/CD look like? How code gets deployed (manual vs automated deployments)? How and when do database migrations get merged? Does the team refactor code and pay down technical debt? When?  You will learn how people give feedback. How much do they nitpick on the small stuff. How much bikeshedding is allowed. How technical discussions are conducted.\nSome teams care about good architecture and design. Others like to do incremental changes, refactoring, and paying down technical debt when needed. While others don‚Äôt really care about any of this stuff and prefer to move fast and break things.\nThese are useful things to know and expect when you submit your first PR. That will give you more confidence.\nTake a peek at routes.rb One simple trick is to look at the routes.rb file first. Routes give you a sense of the endpoints and features that are available without having to go too deep into the codebase.\nYou will know if the project has an external API or not, which is very useful information.\nRead Related Code Take a look at code related to the feature you‚Äôre working on. Models, Controllers, and the Schema or related migrations are good places to look.\nLet the Team Help: Submit Your PR and Ask for Feedback Your new team wants you to be successful. That‚Äôs why they hired you in the first place: because you‚Äôre a great developer and you kick ass!\nLet them help you be successful.\nYou can always submit your PR as is and wait for feedback. Let people help you finish it. You‚Äôll never know everything up front, there‚Äôs no point in trying to make it perfect on the first try.\nIf you get stuck, ask for help. Let people help you! There‚Äôs no shame in that.\nRemember to add enough context in the Pull Request description so people can understand what you are trying to do.\nHow to receive feedback Constructive feedback is always valuable. Listening to constructive criticism is how you learn and get better.\n Ask: what can I learn from the feedback I‚Äôve received?\n Ask questions so you can understand their point of view. Be curious and open-minded.\nDon‚Äôt worry too much if people request changes or point to you things that could be improved. Don‚Äôt be afraid to make mistakes.\n Ask: did I add enough context in the Pull Request description?\n Sometimes they don‚Äôt have enough context into what you are doing. In that case, add more context to help them.\nSometimes they have a point and they are right. Be flexible and open, as they are giving you feedback so the team can ship good code. They could be asking you to follow some of the team‚Äôs conventions that you might not know of.\nOther times, the reviewer just thinks differently than you. This is also fine. No two developers would ever write code, in the same manner, and style, all the time. For these types of requests, you can politely disagree.\nWith time you will learn how to separate changes that are ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù but don‚Äôt make any real difference, and changes that are really important.\nHaving integrity and being assertive are hallmarks of a confident coder. Be graceful when receiving feedback. Even if people do criticize you for no good reason, don‚Äôt take it personally. Be kind, be gentle, and remember: your work does not define your value as a person.\nAsking questions is an effective way to change your approach to receiving criticism. By asking a question, you stop judging yourself or others, and you start to be more curious.\nThe Confident Developer Onboarding Checklist Here‚Äôs a quick checklist you can use for self-onboarding ‚úÖ\n Ask for some time off before I start Ask for documentation or onboarding materials Take advantage of the onboarding process Find an onboarding buddy Understand the issue or feature request I‚Äôm working on Look at the latest merged Pull Requests Take a peek at the routes.rb file, or any code related to my work Let the team help me Get out of code perfectionism paralysis Ask for feedback Learn from the received feedback  If you have other ideas that helped you in the past and want me to add them here, please let me know! üí°\n Hope you apply these strategies to give you more confidence in your first few weeks at your new developer job.\nPrint your checklist and don‚Äôt forget to use it!

There&rsquo;s no shame in that.</p><p>Remember to add enough context in the Pull Request description so people can understand what you are trying to do.</p><h2 id=how-to-receive-feedback>How to receive feedback<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-receive-feedback>#</a></h2><p>Constructive feedback is always valuable. Listening to constructive criticism is how you learn and get better.</p><blockquote><p>Ask: what can I learn from the feedback I&rsquo;ve received?</p></blockquote><p>Ask questions so you can understand their point of view. <strong>Be curious and open-minded</strong>.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t worry too much if people request changes or point to you things that could be improved. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to make mistakes.</p><blockquote><p>Ask: did I add enough context in the Pull Request description?</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes they don&rsquo;t have enough context into what you are doing. In that case, add more context to help them.</p><p>Sometimes they have a point and they are right. Be flexible and open, as they are giving you feedback so the team can ship good code. They could be asking you to follow some of the team&rsquo;s conventions that you might not know of.</p><p>Other times, the reviewer just thinks differently than you. This is also fine. No two developers would ever write code, in the same manner, and style, all the time. For these types of requests, you can politely disagree.</p><p>With time you will learn how to separate changes that are &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; but don&rsquo;t make any real difference, and changes that are really important.</p><p>Having integrity and being assertive are hallmarks of a confident coder. Be graceful when receiving feedback. Even if people do criticize you for no good reason, don&rsquo;t take it personally.
Be kind, be gentle, and remember: your work does not define your value as a person.</p><p>Asking questions is an effective way to change your approach to receiving criticism. By asking a question, you stop judging yourself or others, and you start to be more curious.</p><h2 id=the-confident-developer-onboarding-checklist>The Confident Developer Onboarding Checklist<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-confident-developer-onboarding-checklist>#</a></h2><p>Here&rsquo;s a quick checklist you can use for self-onboarding ‚úÖ</p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Ask for some time off before I start</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Ask for documentation or onboarding materials</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Take advantage of the onboarding process</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Find an onboarding buddy</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Understand the issue or feature request I&rsquo;m working on</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Look at the latest merged Pull Requests</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Take a peek at the <code>routes.rb</code> file, or any code related to my work</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Let the team help me</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Get out of code perfectionism paralysis</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Ask for feedback</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Learn from the received feedback</li></ul><p>If you have other ideas that helped you in the past and want me to add them here, please let me know! üí°</p><hr><p>Hope you apply these strategies to give you more confidence in your first few weeks at your new developer job.</p><p>Print your checklist and don&rsquo;t forget to use it!
