But all you have for lunch every day is a big bowl of legacy spaghetti code.\nYou consider yourself a decent developer, but you‚Äôre never sure how to organize a project. How to name things. Where some piece of business logic should live.\nHow can you become a Ruby on Rails expert if the code you read every day stinks? ü¶®\nIs it possible to learn and follow best practices when you‚Äôre trapped in a big ball of stale legacy code?\nOf course, it is! Start changing your coding diet today by consuming something healthier.\nYes, it‚Äôs going to take some work. But don‚Äôt get discouraged. If you want to advance your skills, you‚Äôve gotta try something different.\nReady to get started?\nFirst: Be Careful When You Ask for Advice You‚Äôre committed to advancing your skills. When you ask people for guidance, they tell you to read a bunch of books and start throwing these terms at you:\n Skinny controllers, fat models, service objects, design patterns, DRY, SOLID, OOP‚Ä¶\n The list goes on.\nIs this information really helpful to you? What are you supposed to do with all of that?\nThe problem is that it‚Äôs not actionable information, just a bunch of ideas and vague suggestions.\nThere is a more practical way to learn all this stuff. Here‚Äôs how.\nOne Exercise to Teach You Ruby on Rails Best Practices Instead of reading another book or watching youtube videos about pasta making during your lunch break, do this exercise instead:\nExercise  Set a timer for 10 minutes. Open this link in another tab: practice.rb from Upcase by Thoughtbot Read the app/services/practice.rb class. Ask yourself: What‚Äôs going on here? Come back here when the time is up! ‚åõ  Sounds good?\nOkay, now go do it! I‚Äôll wait for you.\n‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¶\n‚è∞ beep! beep! beep! beep!\nNow that the time is up, answer at least one of these questions:\n Why is this class so short? It‚Äôs less than a hundred lines! Why is the variable trails being passed down to the initialize constructor? Did you notice these methods promoted_unstarted_trails and unpromoted_unstarted_trails? Why do you think they were given these names, and what‚Äôs the difference between them? What is this class responsible for? ü§î What else picked your interest?  Write down the questions and your answers to make them stick.\nLast but not least:\n Repeat this exercise tomorrow, but pick a different class from the same repository. Add a daily reminder to your calendar so you don‚Äôt forget about it. üìÖ  It‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt understand anything The goal of this exercise is to notice some patterns. Not to understand every single line of code.\nUse your answers to the questions above as a study guide. Even if you answered ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù, that‚Äôs useful information.\nIt‚Äôs okay if you feel uncomfortable Feeling uncomfortable means you‚Äôre doing something different. You‚Äôre challenging yourself. You‚Äôre learning and growing.\nIf you‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúOMG this code is too clean and my code is super dirty!\" or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never be able to work on such a clean codebase!\", don‚Äôt worry!\nThat‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs not the point of this exercise.\nThe point of this exercise is to read the code and notice anything that looks different or any interesting pattern.\nFrequently Asked Questions Here are the answers to some questions you might have about this exercise.\nHow am I going to learn anything just by reading one class? It might seem like it‚Äôs not much.\nIf you do this every day, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen:\n At the very least, you‚Äôre going to learn how the Upcase codebase works. You will pick up new ideas and patterns. You will end up with a list of things you don‚Äôt understand. That‚Äôs a great guide on what you need to focus on. You will see how other experts structure a project to make the code neat and clean. You will learn how to find answers to your own questions and how to read source code.  That‚Äôs pretty good, right?\nAll professional developers and experts have these skills. It comes from practice.\nWhy Pick a Well-Written Codebase? Good question. You have to be exposed to good code if you want to advance your skills. Especially if you don‚Äôt have this opportunity at work.\nIf your goal is to learn best practices, you have to read a well-written codebase.\nThoughtbot, the company behind Upcase, is well-known in the Ruby on Rails community for setting industry standards and following good coding practices.\nWhat if I get stuck? When that happens, ask one of your colleagues for help.\nIf that doesn‚Äôt work or you don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that, ask Rails Forum or Reddit.\nYou can also send me a DM on Twitter and I‚Äôll be happy to help.\nCan you give me other examples of questions to ask? I‚Äôm glad you asked!\nSome other interesting questions you may ask:\n What does this class/object afford? What is the potential action enabled by this class/object? What are the dependencies of this class? How would I feel if I had to use this class (happy, angry, confused)? Why is this code here and not somewhere else? If I call this method, how much do I need to know about its implementation?  Be curious.\nEven when you think you know something well, challenge your knowledge about it by asking interesting questions.\nIt can be hard to separate understanding from memory or just familiarity.\nSometimes you think you understand a concept because it‚Äôs familiar to you. You remember it vividly. But you‚Äôre not able to explain the idea to anyone, even to yourself. And that‚Äôs not fun!\nIs there a list of projects I can use for this exercise? Sure thing! When you‚Äôre finished with Upcase, you can pick a different project to study.\nBut BEWARE: Analysis paralysis is a real thing, so be careful!\nIt‚Äôs easy to procrastinate instead of doing real work and practicing.\nDon‚Äôt waste too much time choosing a project. Pick one at a time and keep practicing.\nI‚Äôve compiled a list of projects and other resources to help you.\n Now that you‚Äôve done this exercise, you will improve your Rails skills every time you practice.\nIt‚Äôs just a matter of consistently exposing yourself to good code. Keep using the suggested questions as a guide, or come up with different ones. Pick a different class every day, and keep going.\nYou‚Äôve already done the hardest part: getting started. Now keep practicing.\nLet me know what you‚Äôve learned by practicing this exercise.\nBookmark this post to keep the questions on hand. Share it with a friend who will find this exercise helpful. ‚≠ê\nHappy learnings! üìì\nPS: I recently gave a talk about this exercise, you can find the slides here üçù\n  Did you like this article?
