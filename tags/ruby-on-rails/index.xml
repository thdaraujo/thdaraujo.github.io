      <title>Move From Sprockets to Webpacker On Small to Large Rails Apps</title>
      <link>https://www.thd.codes/posts/from-sprockets-to-webpacker/</link>

      <description>Rails 6 comes with Sprockets and Webpacker by default. Confusing, right?
The default configuration is Webpacker for Javascript while Sprockets takes care of all the rest (CSS, images, fonts&amp;hellip;).
Let me tell you a secret: You don&amp;rsquo;t need both. Just use Webpacker.
 Legacy applications and older gems still use Sprockets to serve assets. This was done to add backwards compatibility. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a good reason to keep Sprockets around, don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Did you always want to help an open-source project like Ruby on Rails, but never got started?
Many people have the interest of contributing to open-source, myself included. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a couple of small contributions, but nothing fancy.
It&amp;rsquo;s a little intimidating, right? You&amp;rsquo;re not part of the group of contributors and you don&amp;rsquo;t really know where to start. You see 800 open issues, but which one should you pick?</description>

      <title>How should I change production data on a new Rails application?</title>

      <description>You need to change production data. You know that doing it manually is unsafe and will definetely cause lots of trouble, like corrupting all you customer&amp;rsquo;s data.
How else should you do it?
You might be spending a lot of time asking yourself these questions:
 Is there a proper rails way to change data in production? Should I run data and schema modifications in one database migration? Should I run rake scripts in production to modify data?</description>
