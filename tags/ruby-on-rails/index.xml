      <description>You want to add bootstrap, or jquery, or react, or any other javascript library/tool/framework the cool kids are using now to your Rails App. üï∂Ô∏è
You search for a tutorial. First, they tell you to import some file on javascript/application.js.
Later, you come accross another tutorial that tells you to use Webpacker.
Eventually, you realize that Rails 6 comes both with Sprockets AND Webpacker set up by default. ü§Ø
In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, Sprockets and Webpacker are two completely different ways to compile and serve static assets.</description>

      <description>Did you always want to help an open-source project like Ruby on Rails, but never got started?
Many people have the interest of contributing to open-source, myself included. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a couple of small contributions, but nothing fancy.
It&amp;rsquo;s a little intimidating, right? You&amp;rsquo;re not part of the group of contributors and you don&amp;rsquo;t really know where to start. You see 800 open issues, but which one should you pick?</description>

      <description>You need to change production data. You know that doing it manually is unsafe and will definetely cause lots of trouble, like corrupting all you customer&amp;rsquo;s data.
How else should you do it?
You might be spending a lot of time asking yourself these questions:
 Is there a proper rails way to change data in production? Should I run data and schema modifications in one database migration? Should I run rake scripts in production to modify data?</description>
