      <description>Someone asked me:
 &amp;ldquo;What should you do when you lose the enthusiasm for coding?&amp;rdquo;
 I got tired of working as a software developer 3 or 4 times in my career. Maybe more. I had burnouts as well, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what burnout was until a couple of years ago. ðŸ˜†
Losing the enthusiasm for coding can be normal: it&amp;rsquo;s hard to do the same thing, day in day out, and not get sick of it after so many years.</description>

      <description>One of my readers asked:
 How do you get started when you join a new company? How do you add features to a codebase that is massive, scary, and completely new to you?
 The first day at your new developer job is just like the first day at a new school. ðŸš¸
A sea of stranger&amp;rsquo;s faces watching your every move. Unfamiliar smells in the hallway.
Every chair is uncomfortable and makes weird noises when you sit.</description>
